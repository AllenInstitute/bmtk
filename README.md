# The Brain Modeling Toolkit

A software development package for building, simulating and analyzing large-scale networks of different levels of resolution.

## Level of Support
We are releasing this code to the public as a tool we expect others to use. Questions concerning bugs and related issues are welcomed. We expect to address them promptly, pull requests will vetted by our staff before inclusion.


## Quickstart
bmtk requires Python 2.7 or 3.5+, plus [additional python dependicies](https://alleninstitute.github.io/bmtk/index.html#base-installation). To install with
base requirements from a command-line:

```bash
 $ git clone https://github.com/AllenInstitute/bmtk.git
 $ cd bmtk
 $ python setup.py install
```

There are examples of building models and running simulations located in docs/examples/. Some of the simulation engines may require additonal requirements to run.
