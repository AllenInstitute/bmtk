Example Networks and Simulations
================================


Mouse V1 Layer 4 Model
-----------------------

A ~45,000 cell model of the primary input layer (L4) of the mouse primary visual cortex. Built using BMTK and simulated
using BioNet:

Mouse V1 Full Column Models
---------------------------

Biologically realistic models of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) with ~230,000 simulated neurons. Contains two
different types of models: A multi-compartmental model using BioNet and a GLIF-based point-neuron model using
PointNet.

Exc-Inh Network Model
---------------------

12,500 randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The models are built using BioNet, PointNet, and PopNet,
providing a good example of how to compare simulations ran across different levels of resolution:
