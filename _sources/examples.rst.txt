Example Networks and Simulations
================================


Mouse V1 Layer 4 Model
-----------------------

A ~45,000 cell model of the primary input layer (L4) of the mouse primary visual cortex. Built using BMTK and simulated
using BioNet:

Mouse V1 Full Column Models
---------------------------

Biologically realistic models of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) with ~230,000 simulated neurons. Contains two
different types of models: A multi-compartmental model using BioNet and a GLIF-based point-neuron model using
PointNet.

Brunel Models
-------------

12,500 neuron models based on the network described in "Dynamics of Sparsely Connected Networks of Excitatory and
Inhibitory Spiking Neurons", Nicolas Brunel, 2000. The models are built using BioNet, PointNet, and PopNet and
is a good metric of how to compare simulations ran across different levels of resultion:
