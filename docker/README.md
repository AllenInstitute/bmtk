docker-bmtk
==============

With Docker you can test and run the bmtk without having to go through the hasssel of installing all the prerequists (incl.
NEURON, NEST, DiPDE, etc). All you need is the Docker client installed on your computer. You can use the bmtk Docker
container through the command-line to build models and run simulations. Or you can use it as a Jupyter Notebook container
to test out existing tutorials/examples, or create new Notebooks yourself

*Note*: You will not be able to utilize parallelization support (MPI) if running bmtk through Docker. Similarly you can
expect memory issues and slowness for larger networks. For building and simulating large networks we recommend installing
bmtk and the required tools natively on your machine.


Getting the Image
------------------

You can pull the bmtk container from DockerHub
```bash
  $ docker pull alleninstitute/bmtk
```

Or to build the image from the bmtk/docker directory
```bash
  $ docker build -t alleninstitute/bmtk .
```


Running the BMTK
----------------

### Through the command-line
To run a network-build or simulation-run bmtk script using the docker container, go to the directory containing your
python script and any necessary supporting files:
```bash
  $ docker run alleninstitute/bmtk -v $(pwd):/home/shared/workspace python <my_script>.py <opts>
```

**NOTE**: All files must be under the directory you are running the command; including network, components, and output
directories. If your config.json files references anything outside the working directory branch things will not work
as expected.

#### NEURON Mechanisms
If you are running BioNet and have special mechanims/mod files that need to be compiled, you can do so by running:
```bash
  $ cd path/to/mechanims
  $ docker run -v $(pwd):/home/shared/workspace/mechanisms nrnivmodl modfiles/
```

### Through Jupyter Notebooks
To run a Jupyter Notebook server:
```bash
  $ docker run -v $(pwd):/home/shared/workspace -p 8888:8888 jupyter
```

Then open a browser to 127.0.0.1:8888/. Any new files and/or notebooks that you want to save permenately should
be created in the workspace folder, otherwise the work will be lost when the server is stopped.
