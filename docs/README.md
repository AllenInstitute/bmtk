#### directory structure

- autodocs/ - scripts and pages for the generation of github-pages html files.
- tutorial/ - Tutorials and guides for using bmtk and its different parts. **New users should start here**.
- examples/ - Various examples of how to build networks, run various simulations, and plot their results. A good place to start for users wanting a quick and dirty introduction (warning: many of these examples are not as well documented as the tutorials).
